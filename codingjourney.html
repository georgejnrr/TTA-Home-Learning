     <p><b><u>COURSE STRUCTURE</u></b></p>
<p>Each module will have either a practical project, i.e. ‘write code with the following functionality...’ or
a small task to complete to demonstrate skills. <br/>Either of these approaches will provide the trainee
with the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the topic.<br/><br/>
The results will not contribute to a ‘pass’ or ‘fail’ of the course but will give feedback to the trainee on
how they are performing. The project or test will be brief enough that it can be marked quickly,<br/> but
still in depth enough to show understanding of the materials. Throughout the course you will develop
a portfolio that will combine all the skills you have learnt.</p><br/> <hr/>

<b>Trainees are welcomed to TTA and introduced to some of the tools they will use during the

apply them throughout the course.</b></p><br/> </center>
